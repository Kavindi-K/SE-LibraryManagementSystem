## Setup and Installation

### Prerequisites
- Java 17 or higher
- Node.js 16 or higher
- Maven 3.6 or higher
- MongoDB Atlas account (or local MongoDB)

### Backend Setup

1. **Navigate to backend directory:**
   ```bash
   cd backend
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   ./mvnw clean install
   ```

3. **Configure MongoDB connection:**
   Update `src/main/resources/application.properties` with your MongoDB connection string:
   ```properties
   spring.data.mongodb.uri=your_mongodb_connection_string
   spring.data.mongodb.database=LibraryDatabase
   ```

4. **Run the backend:**
   ```bash
   ./mvnw spring-boot:run
   ```
   Backend will start on http://localhost:8080

### Frontend Setup

1. **Navigate to frontend directory:**
   ```bash
   cd frontend
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Start the development server:**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```
   Frontend will start on http://localhost:5173

## Usage

### Adding a New Member
1. Click "Add New Member" button
2. Fill in all required fields:
   - First Name and Last Name
   - Email (must be unique)
   - Phone number
   - Address
   - Date of Birth
   - Select Membership Type
3. Click "Add Member" to save

### Editing a Member
1. Click "Edit" button next to any member
2. Modify the desired fields
3. Click "Update Member" to save changes

### Searching Members
- Use the search bar to find members by name, email, or phone
- Use the dropdown filter to show only specific membership types
- Combine search and filter for refined results

### Deleting a Member
1. Click "Delete" button next to any member
2. Confirm the deletion in the popup dialog

## Sample Data
The system automatically creates 5 sample members on first startup:
- John Doe (Student) - Active
- Jane Smith (Faculty) - Active with small fine
- Bob Johnson (Regular) - Active
- Alice Wilson (Premium) - Active
- Charlie Brown (Student) - Inactive with fine

## Database Schema (MongoDB)

### Members Collection
```json
{
  "_id": "ObjectId",
  "firstName": "String",
  "lastName": "String", 
  "email": "String (indexed, unique)",
  "phone": "String (indexed)",
  "address": "String",
  "dateOfBirth": "Date",
  "membershipType": "String (STUDENT|FACULTY|REGULAR|PREMIUM)",
  "membershipStartDate": "DateTime",
  "membershipEndDate": "DateTime", 
  "isActive": "Boolean",
  "fineAmount": "Number",
  "createdAt": "DateTime",
  "updatedAt": "DateTime"
}
```

### Indexes Created
- `firstName` (text index for search)
- `lastName` (text index for search)  
- `email` (unique index)
- `phone` (index for search)

## Testing

### Backend Testing
Test the API endpoints using tools like Postman or curl:

```bash
# Get all members
curl http://localhost:8080/api/members

# Search members
curl "http://localhost:8080/api/members/search?q=john"

# Get membership types
curl http://localhost:8080/api/members/membership-types
```

### Frontend Testing
1. Open http://localhost:5173 in your browser
2. Test all CRUD operations through the UI
3. Verify search and filtering functionality
4. Test form validation by submitting invalid data

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **MongoDB Connection Error:**
   - Verify MongoDB URI in application.properties
   - Check if MongoDB Atlas IP whitelist includes your IP

2. **CORS Errors:**
   - Ensure frontend is running on http://localhost:5173
   - Check SecurityConfig.java CORS configuration

3. **Port Already in Use:**
   - Backend: Change server.port in application.properties
   - Frontend: Vite will automatically suggest alternative port

4. **Build Errors:**
   - Ensure Java 17+ is installed
   - Run `./mvnw clean install` to refresh dependencies

## Future Enhancements (For Other Sprints)
- Integration with Books module for borrowing limits
- Advanced search with date ranges
- Member photo uploads
- Email notifications for membership expiry
- Export member data to CSV/PDF
- Member statistics dashboard
